# DOS-Attack
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an intentional cyberattack carried out on networks, websites, and online resources to restrict access to its legitimate users. This is usually done by overloading the target network or site with fake system requests, preventing legitimate users from accessing it, sometimes crashing or damaging a system outright1. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash2. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS attack that comes from many distributed sources, such as a botnet DDoS attack
